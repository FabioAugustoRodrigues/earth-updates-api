## What is TerraUpdates?
TerraUpdates is an API designed to deliver real-time news and updates about the Earth. From environmental changes and scientific discoveries to significant global events, TerraUpdates provides accurate, up-to-date information to keep you informed about whatâ€™s happening on our planet.

Built for developers, this API offers seamless integration with your applications, enabling you to provide timely and relevant Earth-related news to your users. In addition to serving updates via API endpoints, TerraUpdates features automated email notifications, ensuring subscribers stay informed about the latest developments.

While its primary intent is to function as a  newsletter tool, developers can adapt it to their specific needs and use cases.
